	<h4>Plumber FAQs</h4>
	
  	<h5>What is 1300 PLUMBER?</h5>
	<p>1300 PLUMBER is Australia's fastest growing connection service for  local, independent plumbers. 1300 PLUMBER is not a franchise, and not  just a phone number. All plumbers subscribed to the network control the  rights to the number in their area and are supplied with an <a href="/advertising" style="text-decoration:underline;">advertising pack</a> to help 'kick start' enquiries.</p>

	<h5>Just what do I get when I sign up for 1300 PLUMBER?</h5>
	<p>When  you <a href="#home" style="text-decoration:underline;">sign up</a> for 1300 PLUMBER, you gain exclusive access to Australia's  most powerful plumbing phone number in your area. You also receive  an <a href="/advertising" style="text-decoration:underline;">advertising pack</a>, free of charge.</p>


	<h5>How many subscribers will there be in a given postcode?</h5>
	<p>Depending on demographics there can only be a maximum of 3 local plumbers per postcode to ensure customers get a quick turnaround time. Some postcodes will only have 1 or 2 plumbers allocated.</p>

	<h5>What does it cost to subscribe to the 1300 PLUMBER service?</h5>

	<p>The price to subscribe to 1300 PLUMBER varies substantially, depending  on your desired postcode(s). The population of a particular postcode is  the major factor influencing its price. In short, the lower the  population of a postcode, the lower its price. Working class areas or  affluent areas have absolutely no bearing on price. Due to strong demand, the Central Business District (CBD) in each capital city is priced at a premium. To view pricing, please visit our <a href="#home" style="text-decoration:underline;">registration/pricing</a> section.</p>

	<p>The only other cost associated with the 1300 PLUMBER service is the  <a href="callrates.cfm" style="text-decoration:underline;">inbound phone calls</a>.  All calls generated from 1300 PLUMBER will be billed separately on a monthly basis. Again, this cost varies depending on the number of  inbound calls you receive. </p>


	<h5>What if another plumber has already subscribed to my desired postcode?</h5>

	<p>As there is total  exclusivity to each and every postcode, the only option left is to register  your details on our 'waiting list'. If the current subscriber surrenders their  subscription, or their subscription is taken away from them, the next plumbing business on the waiting list will be offered that area. To be placed on the waiting list, follow the <a href="apply.cfm" style="text-decoration:underline;">registration</a> process by entering your desired postcode, then click on the waiting list link.</p>
